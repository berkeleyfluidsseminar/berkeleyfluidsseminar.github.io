<p align="justify"> 
Meddies are large coherent anticyclones which form at Gibraltar
Straits, where warm and salty water from the Mediterranean sea exits
in the Atlantic Ocean. These vortical structures show a striking long
lifetime of 2-3 years. The understanding of the fundamental mecha-
nisms which allow Meddies to persist for such a long time, motivates
our experimental, numerical and theoretical study.
We look at the time evolution of an isolated vortex generated by
injecting a small amount of fluid at the center of a rotating tank filled
with salty water linearly stratified in density. In experiments, the fluid
motion is investigated using PIV techniques, providing the velocity
field in the plane orthogonal to the vorticity vector. Our two control
parameters are the background Coriolis and buoyancy frequencies.
We observe that vortices universally take an ellipsoidal shape de-
fined by the geostrophic equilibrium, and slowly evolve in a quasi-
steady self-similar way. They expand in the radial direction and slow
down, but remain extremely coherent over several hundreds of back-
ground rotations. Fluid equations can be simplified in the limit of
small Rossby and Ekman numbers. At the first order in time, we ob-
tain a diffusion like equation for the pressure, the density anomaly and
the azimuthal velocity in the vortex. The behavior of the vortex de-
pends on the ratio between the background Coriolis and buoyancy fre-
quencies. When these two frequencies are equal, an exact self-similar
solution is found, predicting a simple power law for the time evolution
of the Rossby number and, surprisingly, a diffusion of the azimuthal
velocity profile in the radial direction only, even when the aspect ratio
of the vortex is small (i.e. pancake shape, like in real meddies). Our
analytical solution is in good agreement with our experimental and
numerical results.
