<p align="center"><b>Mixing in wall-bounded turbulent flows</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">The advancement of the knowledge on the correct parameterization of diapycnal mixing is essential for prediction of the dynamics of the ocean and its role on long-term processes such as climate change. However, prediction of turbulent mixing is not trivial particularly in wall-bounded turbulent flows due to the highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic nature of such flows, especially close to the wall. In this talk, we provide an analysis of turbulent mixing in stably stratified wall-bounded flows to highlight a number of important issues such as prediction of the turbulent viscosity, the turbulent diffusivity, and the irreversible flux Richardson number. We then extend our discussions by deriving the velocity and length scales which are approximations for the scales needed to calculate the turbulent viscosity. </p>
