<p align="center"><b>Higher-order, Conservative Embedded Boundary Discretizations for PDE's</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">Embedded boundary (“cut cell”) approaches for solving PDE's have reduced cost for grid generation and computation, but increased complications around high accuracy, numerical stability, and other important discretization qualities. We present a general mathematical and software framework (based on our group's Chombo software framework), along with some examples of model problems and science applications we are developing. The biggest open questions involve tradeoffs, including stability (theory of "small cells")  and reliability (complex geometry, software) issues, but in some cases these are outweighed by the benefits of conservation, accuracy, and performance. </p>
