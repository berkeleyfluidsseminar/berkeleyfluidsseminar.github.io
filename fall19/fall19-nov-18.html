Simulating complex multi-scale physical systems often involves solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with closures for the unresolved scales. Although the advancement of high-performance computing has made resolving small-scale physics possible, such simulations are still very expensive. Therefore, reliable and accurate closure models for the unresolved physics remains an important requirement for many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. We present two deep learning-based approaches to developing predictive models for unresolved physics. 
<br><br>
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promise in emulating solutions of PDEs governing complex systems without explicitly solving these PDEs. However, GANs are known to be difficult to train and to achieve convergence. We present a constrained GAN by enforcing constraints of covariance from the training data, which results in an improved deep-learning-based emulator that can capture the higher-order statistics of the physical system it models. We exemplify this approach on Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC), an idealized model of turbulent atmospheric convection. 
<br><br>
In the second part of this talk, we aim to predict the same turbulent flow (RBC) by learning its nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call Turbulent-Flow Net (TF-Net), is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility
of learned representations.  We compare our model, TF-Net, with state-of-the-art baselines and observe reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most significantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate
prediction of turbulent flows.
<br><br>
Given the ever-growing high-fidelity simulation databases of physical systems, this work shows potential as alternatives to the explicit modeling of closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be a major source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems.
