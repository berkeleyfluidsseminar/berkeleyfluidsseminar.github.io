<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Our environment is replete with examples of particles interacting with
turbulent flows. Tiny phytoplankton drift through the ocean by being
passively carried by turbulence. A fish on the other hand swims through
turbulence using its propulsive efficiency. Of interest to this research are
the particles (such as copepods) of intermediate size that interact with
turbulence in more complex and curious ways. In the first half of this talk,
Dr. Bordoloi will expand this motivation through some results from laboratory experiments conducted over the past few years. He will discuss
the rotational statistics of intermediate-size-particles in homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. The second half of this talk is motivated by another
type of particle-turbulence interaction wherein a plume of particles (such
as marine snow) sediment through water and generate turbulence in the
interstitial fluid. Herein, Dr. Bordoloi will discuss new experimental evidence that characterizes the turbulence in a particle plume and sets them
in a category different from the conventional “shear induced turbulence”.

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio:</b> Dr. Ankur Bordoloi is a postdoctoral research associate in the Civil & Environmental Engineering department at UC
Berkeley. He received his PhD in Aerospace Engineering &#38; Mechanics at the University of Minnesota. Prior to coming to Berkeley this summer, he worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He has conducted research in multiple areas in fluid mechanics, including droplet dynamics (coalescence, impact, constricted motion, wettability) particle-turbulence interactions (particle kinematics in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, turbulence in particle plume), shock wave in multiphase medium (shock-particle interactions, unsteady drag estimation) etc. that have applications in geophysical flows, marine biology, environmental science, biomedical design, and aerospace engineering.
