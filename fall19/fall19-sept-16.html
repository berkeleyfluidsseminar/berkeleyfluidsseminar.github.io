<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Modern tools in machine learning and deep learning can offer new insights to old problems, both on the methodological side as well as on the technical side. 

In the first half of my talk, I will present an overview of tools and subfields in geometric deep learning that are particularly relevant and applicable to physical problems, (e.g., learning on regular grids,  meshes&sol;graphs and point clouds, equivalent representations using spherical harmonics etc.), including a few of my recent work in this area. Specifically for the fluids audience, we will discuss some recent work that use deep learning methodologies towards fluids applications. 

In the second half of the talk, I will discuss various computational tools that have been developed in the deep learning realm including GPU-based frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow) that have various unique properties (python friendly, GPU ready, high performance, built-in differentiability). Such frameworks offer the possibility of writing high-performance linear algebra code with a high level user friendly numpy-like programming interface, that can execute computation agnostic to the specific hardware (CPU, GPU, parallel computation on a cluster). Though designed with deep learning applications in mind, these computational tools might appeal to a wider audience in other computational fields for its flexibility and high performance.
