<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
With the recent developments of new technologies, biomedical engineering and medicine, the need for new mathematical and numerical methodologies to aid these developments has never been greater. This talk will outline the development of a general framework to study fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involving incompressible, viscous fluids and various elastic or viscoelastic structures. In particular, we will show a new approach to the modeling of FSI involving mesh-supported or fiber-reinforced structures such as arterial walls treated with vascular prostheses called stents. The approach is based on dimension reduction to model mesh-like devices such as vascular stents as one-dimensional PDEs defined on a graph. These are coupled with the elastodynamics of multi-layered, composite structures, such as arterial walls, and with the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, such as blood. We will show how this approach is applied to: (1) study the interaction between blood flow and stented coronary arteries sitting on a beating heart; (2) optimal design of a stent for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), giving rise to the first, pre-cramped, ready-to-use bioartificial aortic valve called the Colibry Valve; and (3) design of a bioartificial pancreas without the need for immunosuppressive therapy.

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio:</b> Sun&ccaron;ica &Ccaron;ani&cacute; (Sunny) came to Berkeley one year ago from the University of Houston, where she held the Cullen Distinguished Chair Professorship position. She works in applied mathematics, nonlinear partial differential equations, and computational methods development. She earned her Ph.D. in 1992 in the area of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws at Stony Brook University under the supervision on Bradley Plohr and James Glimm. Upon her move to the University of Houston in 1999, she began collaborating with several medical specialists on problems related to cardiovascular treatment and diagnosis. She was honored for her research by the NSF as Distinguished MPS Lecturer in 2007, she received the US Congressional Recognition for Top Women in Technology in 2006, and the most prestigious award at the University of Houston, the Esther Farfel Award in 2018. In 2014 she was elected Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and in 2019 a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Her research influenced the design of a stent for a bio-artificial aortic valve, now used in patients around the world.  </p>
