<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
This talk will cover two largely distinct topics under the umbrella of high-order methods for compressible flow problems. First, we will discuss a computationally efficient adjoint method with fully implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) schemes. The fully discrete adjoint equations and corresponding adjoint method for unsteady PDE-constrained optimization problems will be introduced, and we will show that the resulting linear systems compare competitively with those derived from diagonally IRK schemes. Our implementation of the IRK adjoint method is tested by computing the energetically optimal trajectory of a 2D airfoil in compressible flow. Secondly, we will introduce a shock-capturing technique for large eddy simulation of compressible flow at transonic speeds. Results from the simulation of the OAT15A airfoil will be presented to show that the judicious application of artificial viscosity can be used to stabilize the high-order method, while accurately modeling the buffet phenomenon.
