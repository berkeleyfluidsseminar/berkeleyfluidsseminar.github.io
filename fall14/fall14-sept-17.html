<p align="center"><b>Kinetic Boltzmann model of multiphase flows</b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> I discuss the motion of interacting particles in the context of kinetic theory and derive the collisional Boltzmann equation when individual particles interact through (i) attractive (ii) attractive--repulsive and (iii) elastic hard sphere collisions. I then present some applications of the Boltzmann equation in the modeling and stability analysis of the flock of animals, and the motion of dust and solid particles in circumstellar disks. I show how an integral equation of the Fredholm-type gives singular and discrete modes of a one dimensional flock, and introduce a new Finite Element Method that I have developed to study the perturbations of circumstellar disks.
Examples that I solve include the excitation of density waves in debris disks by close encounters of stars, and the drag-induced pattern formation in the dust component of protoplanetary disks. I also explain how the method can be used to investigate interfacial instabilities in suspension and particle-laden flows.</p>
