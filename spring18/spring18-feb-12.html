<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> A striking feature of
particle-laden turbulent flows is the tendency of the disperse phase
to cluster. This phenomenon, known as preferential concentration, is
pervasive at all scales, e.g. atmospheric and oceanic flows (planetary
scale), urban flows (human-habitat scale) and biological flows (human
scale). For Computational Fluid Dynamics to contribute to engineering
design and physical understanding, affordable computations of
transport processes at the macroscale are required. However, the
stringent resolution requirement imposed by the smallest scales is
generally incompatible with this objective, which motivates the
pursuit of large-eddy simulation wherein only the largest scales are
resolved by the computational grid. When the effect of the unresolved
small scales on the transport and interphase exchange of momentum and
energy are significant, appropriate subgrid-scale modeling is
required.

In this talk, I will focus on three subgrid-scale modeling strategies
for tackling this challenging problem of large-eddy simulation for
particle-laden turbulent flows. The first is an approximate
deconvolution based on elliptic differential filters. The second is
based on the deterministic synthesis of small-scale turbulence. Both
do not require any tunable parameters and are flexible enough to be
deployed in any type of flow solver and grid. Finally, I will present
an alternative wavelet-based modeling strategy, which enables dynamic
refinement of the grid around particle clusters, particularly relevant
for radiative heat transfer simulations.
