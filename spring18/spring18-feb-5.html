<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> The flow contained in a
rotating circular split-cylinder with different associated boundary
conditions leads to a variety of instabilities and complex
dynamics. The study of a wide range of Direct Numerical Simulations of
the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations elucidated the flow
behavior.

In the first configuration presented in detail, there exists a strong
background rotation with oscillatory boundary conditions. By imposing
a desired range of frequencies, inertial wave beams emanate from the
corner and the split of the cylinder, leading to
destructive/constructive interactions. The resulting flow produces
peaks in vorticity for some specific frequencies which are related to
the resonant Kelvin modes. The critical role of the symmetries of the
boundary conditions with the different Kelvin modes excited was
studied using the phase difference parameter, which easily allows
imposing different symmetries.

In the second configuration, both cylinder halves are in exact
counter-rotation, producing an O(2) symmetry in the system. In the
Basic State, the dynamic of the flow is dominated by the shear layer
created in the midplane. By changing the speed rotation and the aspect
ratio of the cylinder, the flow loses symmetries in a variety of ways
creating static waves, rotating waves, direction reversing waves and
slow-fast pulsing waves. The bifurcations were characterized and the
flow dynamics were clarified. Additionally, preliminary experimental
results for this case were performed. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b> Paloma Gutierrez Castillo was born
and raised in Malaga, Spain where she also completed her undergraduate
degree in Industrial Engineering, equivalent to Aerospace or
Mechanical Engineering in the United States.  During her undergraduate
thesis, she had the first contact with researching in Fluid Mechanics,
both in experimental and numerical approaches, resulting in her first
publication.  After finishing her undergraduate degree, she obtained
her Masters in Environmental Hydraulics, also in Spain.

  Paloma moved to the US to pursue her Ph.D.. She earned her Ph.D. in
Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University where she was
alternatively a TA and RA from 2012-2016. In her last year, she got
ASU’s Graduate Education Dissertation Fellowship, a University-wide
Fellowship, and graduated in May 2017.  Her dissertation, “Rotating
split-cylinder flows,” is a numerical study of the behavior of the
flow contained in a rotating split cylinder including three
geometries: differentially rotating halves, oscillatory differentially
rotating halves, and counter-rotating halves. The study focuses on the
instabilities and inertial waves present in the flow as well as the
study of the resulting bifurcations. It also contains a small
experimental part. The work included in her dissertation is published
in four papers in prestigious international journals, and was
recognized with the Graduate Student Research Award of the School of
Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at Arizona State University.  In
July 2017 Paloma started a new exciting stage in her career: moving to
UC Davis, where she felt very welcome. She started working on
different computational projects related with complex fluids including
Immersed Boundary Methods, Adaptive Mesh Refinement, and Elastic
Turbulence. Currently, she is teaching MAT 025, Advanced Calculus. </p>
