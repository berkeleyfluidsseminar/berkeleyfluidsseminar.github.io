<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Many microorganisms and
artificial microswimmers (such as catalytic colloids) are able to move
under their own power. They achieve this by constantly consuming fuel,
forming a non-equilibrium state of matter. This is relevant both to
real world applications such as nano-technology, as well as for posing
fundamental questions in non-equilibrium statistical
physics. Microswimmers are often modeled as active Brownian particles,
neglecting hydrodynamic interactions between them. However, real
microswimmers, such as ciliated microorganisms, catalytic Janus
particles, or active emulsion droplets, employ propulsion mechanisms
reliant on hydrodynamics. After giving an overview of different
propulsion mechanisms, we to explore the influence of hydrodynamics on
the collective behavior microswimmers in a quasi-two-dimensional
geometry and on their motion under gravity.

A striking consequence of active motion is that for sufficiently
strong self-propulsion they phase separate into dense clusters
coexisting with a low-density disordered surrounding. Here we examine
the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on motility-induced phase
separation. For a range of mean densities and Peclet numbers, we
observe how the system decomposes into a dilute and a cluster phase,
which then coarsens over time.  Inspired by experiments and
theoretical work, we also examine collective dynamics in the presence
of gravity. We observe a rich phenomenology, depending not only on the
relative strength of gravity but also on the long-range hydrodynamic
interactions between swimmers and with the container's walls. </p>

discovery methods for large complex systems such as Earthâ€™s
climate. He was the winner of the Leonardo da Vinci prize in 2013 for
the best PhD thesis in Europe in flow, turbulence and combustion, and
winner of the Osborne Reynolds prize in 2012 in the U.K. for
outstanding research in fluid dynamics. He has also won best paper
awards from the Combustion Institute of the U.K. and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers. When he is not in front of the
computer or in the lab, he runs up mountains, swims in lakes and cooks
exotic global cuisines.
