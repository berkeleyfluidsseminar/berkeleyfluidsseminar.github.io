<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b>When organisms locomote and interact in nature, they must navigate through complex habitats that vary on many spatial scales, and they are buffeted by turbulent wind or water currents and waves that also vary on a range of spatial and temporal scales.  We have been using the microscopic larvae of bottom-dwelling marine animals to study how the interaction between the swimming or crawling by an organism and the turbulent water flow around them determines how they move through the environment.  Many bottom-dwelling marine animals produce microscopic larvae that are dispersed to new sites by ambient water currents, and then must land and stay put on surfaces in suitable habitats.  Field and flume measurements enabled us to quantify the fine-scale, rapidly-changing patterns of water velocity vectors and of chemical cue concentrations near coral reefs. We also measured the swimming and crawling performance of larvae of reef-dwelling animals, and their responses to chemical cues.  We used these data to design agent-based models of larval behavior.  By putting model larvae into our real-world flow and chemical data, which varied on spatial and temporal scales experienced by microscopic larvae, we could explore how the behavior of larvae affected their transport and their recruitment into reefs.</p>

Engineering from Rice University and M.S./Ph.D. degrees in Civil &
Environmental Engineering from Cornell University. As a doctoral
student, Allie developed a new RANS model for flow through aquatic
vegetation, which she will talk about today. As a Postdoc in the same
department, Allie worked on coupling near-field dynamics of cooling
water outfalls to three-dimensional hydrodynamic models. As a Research
Associate in Cornell's Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology,
Allie is working to understanding the role of internal waves in
delivery of Phosphorus to cyanobacteria.  </p>
