<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Flow and transport through
aquatic vegetation is characterized by a wide range of length scales
including water depth (H), stem diameter (d), the inverse of the plant
frontal area per unit volume (af), and the scale(s) over which af
varies (the most easily identified is the plant height, h).
Turbulence is generated both at the scale(s) of the mean vertical
shear, set by the inverse of af, and at the scale(s) of the stem
wakes, set by d.  While turbulence from each of these sources is
dissipated through the energy cascade, some shear-scale turbulence
bypasses the lower wave numbers as shear-scale eddies do work against
the form drag of the plant stems, converting shear-scale turbulence
into wake-scale turbulence. We have developed a k-epsilon model that
accounts for all of these energy pathways. The model is calibrated
against laboratory data from beds of rigid cylinders under emergent
and submerged conditions. The new model outperforms existing models,
none of which include the d scale, both in the emergent case, where
existing models break down entirely, and in the submerged case, where
existing models fail to predict the strong dependence of turbulent
kinetic energy on d. The success of the new model supports our current
understanding of the turbulent kinetic energy budget in flow through
vegetation. The new model was developed with applications in real
aquatic vegetation in mind, and may be easily incorporated into larger
hydrodynamic solvers for field applications.</p>

Engineering from Rice University and M.S./Ph.D. degrees in Civil &
Environmental Engineering from Cornell University. As a doctoral
student, Allie developed a new RANS model for flow through aquatic
vegetation, which she will talk about today. As a Postdoc in the same
department, Allie worked on coupling near-field dynamics of cooling
water outfalls to three-dimensional hydrodynamic models. As a Research
Associate in Cornell's Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology,
Allie is working to understanding the role of internal waves in
delivery of Phosphorus to cyanobacteria.  </p>
