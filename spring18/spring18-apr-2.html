<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Due to the unrivaled energy
density of liquid hydrocarbon fuels combustion will continue to
provide over 80% of the world’s energy for at least the next fifty
years. Hence, combustion needs to be understood and controlled to
optimize combustion systems for efficiency to prevent further climate
change, to reduce emissions and to ensure U.S. energy security and
competitiveness.  In this talk I will discuss progress in direct
numerical simulations of turbulent combustion focused on providing
fundamental insights into key ‘turbulence-chemistry’ interactions that
underpin the development of next generation fuel efficient, fuel
flexible engines for transportation and power generation. Petascale
direct numerical simulation (DNS) of multi-stage mixed-mode turbulent
combustion have elucidated key physics that govern autoignition and
flame stabilization in engines and provide benchmark data for
combustion model development under the conditions of next generation
engines, which operate near combustion limits to maximize efficiency
and to minimize emissions. Mixed-mode combustion refers to premixed or
partially-premixed flames propagating into compositionally stratified
(non)reacting/autoignitive mixtures. Multi-stage ignition refers to
hydrocarbon fuels with negative temperature coefficient behavior that
undergo sequential low- and high-temperature autoignition.  Some of
the issues addressed include the role of entrainment and mixing in
turbulent shear flows on the dynamics of multi-stage ignition, and the
balance of flame propagation versus spontaneous ignition in
contributing to the overall combustion rate.

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b> Jacqueline H. Chen is a
Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at the Combustion Research
Facility at Sandia National Laboratories.  She has contributed broadly
to research in petascale and exascale direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of turbulent combustion focusing on fundamental
turbulence-chemistry interactions underlying the design of fuel
efficient clean burning engines. These benchmark simulations provide
fundamental insight into combustion processes and are used by the
combustion modeling community to develop and validate turbulent
combustion models for engineering computational fluid dynamics.  In
collaboration with computer scientists and applied mathematicians she
was the founding Director of the Center for Exascale Simulation of
Combustion in Turbulence (ExaCT).  She led an interdisciplinary
multi-laboratory team to co-design DNS numerical algorithms,
domain-specific programming environments, scientific data management
and in situ uncertainty quantification and analytics, and
architectural simulation and modeling with combustion proxy
applications.  She is also the principal investigator of a DOE
Exascale Simulation Project focused on combustion simulation. She is a
member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the
Combustion Institute.  She received the DOE INCITE Award between
2005-2018 and the 34th International Combustion Symposium
Distinguished Paper Award in 2012.  She is a member of the DOE
Advanced Scientific Computing Research advisory committee (ASCAC) and
a member of the Combustion Institute board of directors. She was the
editor of Flow, Turbulence and Combustion, the co-editor of the
Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, volumes 29 and 30, and the
Co-Chair of the Local Organizing Committee for the 35th International
Combustion Symposium.  </p>
