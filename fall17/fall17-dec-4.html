<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Synchronization is a universal
concept in nonlinear science but has received little attention in
thermoacoustics. We investigate the influence of harmonic acoustic
forcing on three different types of self-excited thermoacoustic
oscillations: periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic. We show that
open-loop application of harmonic acoustic forcing is an effective
strategy for controlling large-amplitude thermoacoustic
oscillations. We find that (i) above a critical forcing amplitude, the
system locks into the acoustic forcing by oscillating only at the
forcing frequency ff, leaving no sign of the natural self-excited
mode; (ii) the critical forcing amplitude required for lock-in
decreases as ff approaches the natural frequencies, giving rise to
characteristic V-shaped lock-in boundaries around the natural modes;
(iii) for a wide range of forcing frequencies, the system’s
oscillation amplitude can be reduced to less than 50% of that of the
unforced system, and in some cases even up to 90%; (iv) amplitude
reduction can be weakened as forcing amplitude is increased above
lock-in boundary. Findings from numerical simulations are corroborated
by experimental measurements. We then model the system as coupled van
der Pol oscillators. We find that the response amplitude of the flame
and lock-in boundary around the natural modes are qualitatively
similar. These findings show that (i) the application of harmonic
acoustic forcing can be an effective strategy for controlling periodic
and aperiodic thermoacoustic oscillations; and (ii) this complex
forced self-excited system can be modelled reasonably well as a simple
forced selfexcited oscillator, which could be helpful to delve deeper
into the dynamics of such systems and to develop new control
strategies.

projects spanning a wide range of disciplines from supersonic
air-breathing engines to battery technologies to acoustics to complex
chaotic systems and turbulence. Since 2013 he has been a part of
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working as a climate and
atmospheric scientist. His current research interests lie in extreme
weather and climate events and novel big data analytics and pattern
discovery methods for large complex systems such as Earth’s
climate. He was the winner of the Leonardo da Vinci prize in 2013 for
the best PhD thesis in Europe in flow, turbulence and combustion, and
winner of the Osborne Reynolds prize in 2012 in the U.K. for
outstanding research in fluid dynamics. He has also won best paper
awards from the Combustion Institute of the U.K. and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers. When he is not in front of the
computer or in the lab, he runs up mountains, swims in lakes and cooks
exotic global cuisines.
