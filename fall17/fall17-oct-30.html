<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> The dynamics of many physical
systems often evolve to asymptotic states that exhibit spatial and
temporal variations in their properties such as density, temperature,
etc. Regular patterns such as graph paper and honeycombs look the same
when moved by a basic unit and/or rotated by certain special
angles. They possess both translational and rotational symmetries
giving rise to discrete spatial Fourier transforms. In contrast, an
aperiodic crystal displays long range order but no periodicity. Such
quasicrystals lack the lattice symmetries of regular crystals, yet
have discrete Fourier spectra. We look to understand the minimal
mechanism which promotes the formation of such quasicrystalline
structures arising in diverse soft matter systems such as dendritic-,
star-, and block co-polymers using a phase field crystal model. Direct
numerical simulations combined with weakly nonlinear analysis
highlight the parameter values where the quasicrystals are the global
minimum energy state and help determine the phase diagram. By locating
parameter values where multiple patterned states possess the same free
energy (Maxwell points), we obtain states where a patch of one type of
pattern (for example, a quasicrystal) is present in the background of
another (for example, the homogeneous liquid state). In a bifurcation
diagram such localized states fall on solution branches that undergo
homoclinic snaking and they can be obtained through numerical
continuation.

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b> Dr. Priya Subramanian completed her
PhD on ‘Dynamical systems approach to the investigation of
thermoacoustic instabilities in 2012. Since then she has worked at the
Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization and is
currently a research fellow at University of Leeds. Her research
interests focus on spatio-temporal pattern formation in a variety of
systems such as thermoacoustic, inclined layer convection and soft
matter crystallization systems along with investigations into the
emergent dynamics in active fluids. She is a L'Oreal-UNESCO Women in
Science UK fellow for this year working on `Mathematical recipes for
never-repeating quasicrystals’.
