<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> A core feature of many living
systems is their ability to move, to self-propel, to be active. From
bird flocks to bacteria swarms, to even cytoskeletal networks, “active
matter” systems exhibit collective and emergent dynamics owing to
their constituents’ ability to convert chemical fuel into mechanical
activity. Here, I present a new framework to interpret living matter
as a material and understand its complex behavior using tools of
hydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics. I combine experimental and computational methods to
demonstrate how intrinsic activity imparts new behaviors to soft
materials that explain a variety of complex phenomena, including the
collective motion of self-propelled particles and the complete loss of
shear viscosity in fluid suspensions. Additionally, I engineer giant
phospholipid vesicles of active matter that model the nonequilibrium
stresses generated by biopolymers and molecular motors inside living
cells. These nature-inspired soft materials have tunable properties
that could be used as mechanical devices with applications in
sustainable manufacturing, robotics, and biotechnology

Fellow in the Bioengineering Department. He obtained his PhD at the
California Institute of Technology, where he worked with Professor
John Brady on the statistical mechanics and rheology of nonequilibrium
active matter fluids. He was also a visiting scholar in Professor Jan
Vermant’s soft matter and interfacial rheology group at ETH
Zürich. Prior to enrolling at Caltech, Sho earned a bachelors in
Chemical Engineering from UC Berkeley. </p>
