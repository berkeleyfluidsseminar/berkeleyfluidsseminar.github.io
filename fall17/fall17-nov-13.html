<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Bacteria come in consistent
shapes and sizes, which serve as one way for individuals or their
aggregate to interact with the living environment. Despite the fact
that a specific morphology is important within a species, there is a
lack of direct evidence on how cellular morphology affects bacterial
fitness, especially regarding their dispersal capabilities and
virulence factors. In this talk, I will discuss whether the motility
traits can provide us an understanding of these specific cellular
morphologies, for instance, the prevalent sizes and geometries of the
rod-like bacteria. I will show that the apparent wobbling movements of
the cell body can essentially benefit swimming motilities, which is
potentially adapted to an aqueous environment. I will also discuss the
dispersal capabilities of a bacterial rosette, known as an aggregate
of sessile cells and prohibited from active dispersals. I will show
that a surprising rolling trait can emerge from both its spherical
geometry and the mechanical nature of its living environments, such as
a solid-liquid interface.

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b> Dr. Bin Liu is an Assistant
Professor in Physics at University of California, Merced. Dr. Liu got
his Ph. D. in Physics at New York University, studying both
multi-fermion systems and collections of mobile boundaries in thermal
convections. He continued his interests in fluids during his
postdoctoral research on fluid-structure interactions in both
biological locomotion and non-Newtonian flows at Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences and later on at Brown University in mechanical
engineering, followed by his studies of origami-based mechanical
metamaterials in the Department of Physics at Cornell
University. Despite these wide interests of research, Dr. Liuâ€™s
current group focuses on the behaviors and transports of live
microorganisms in complex mechanical environments at both solitary and
collective levels.
