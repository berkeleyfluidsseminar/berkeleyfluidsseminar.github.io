<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Density fronts form between the
  saline ocean and fresh water from river input.  These frontal
  regions modulate the sea surface temperature and thereby air-sea
  interaction through submesoscale (horizontal scale less than a few
  km) features and associated vertical fluxes. We use LES to examine
  the nonlinear evolution of flow instabilities and turbulence at
  fronts that are initially in geostrophic balance. Fronts with strong
  horizontal gradient develop a cross-front circulation that
  strengthens and eventually leads to a surface gravity current. This
  process may help understand recent shipboard observations in the Bay
  of Bengal that have identified gravitycurrent features at fronts
  that are unusually strong and thin.  When the horizontal density
  gradient is moderate, the flow exhibits symmetric instability
  (slantwise convection), baroclinic instability as well as mixed
  modes.  Vortex filaments form and are found to break down into
  three-dimensional turbulence as well as to organize and form
  submesoscale vortices.  We will discuss the variation of flow
  properties as a function of the upper-ocean vertical stratification
  in both cases: strong and moderate horizontal density gradient.
