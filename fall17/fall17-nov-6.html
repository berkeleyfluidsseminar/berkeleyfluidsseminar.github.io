<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Combined electromechanical and
hemodynamic computer models of the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta
are considered an important tool for analyzing the interplay between
LV deformation, valvular anatomy and flow patterns. Typically,
image-based kinematic models describing endocardial motion or
MRI-based flow measurements in the LV outflow tract are used as an
input to blood flow simulations. While such models are suitable for
analyzing the hemodynamic status quo, they are limited in predicting
the response to interventions that alter afterload conditions, as this
approach assumes that the heartbeat itself will remain unchanged.
Electro-mechano-fluidic (EMF) simulations of the LV have the potential
to overcome this limitation, but are more difficult to formulate,
parameterize and compute. In this talk, I report on our recent
advancements in developing an automated workflow for the creation of
patient-specific EMF models of the LV and the aorta that are suitable
to drive blood flow simulations. Models are custom-tailored to
individual patients to ensure that the in-silico simulation replicates
clinical observations for a given patient. These models can be used to
probe the effect of different therapeutic options and thus identify
the therapy that yields the best post-treatment outcome.

a Marie Curie post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at UC Berkeley. Prior to this, he obtained his M.S. and
Ph.D. in mathematics and biomechanics from Graz University of
Technology and was a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of
Biophysics at the Medical University of Graz, Austria. His main
research interests are multi-physics problems, in particular the
electro-mechano-fluidic modeling of the heart, and their numerical
simulation using high-performance and massively parallel computing.
