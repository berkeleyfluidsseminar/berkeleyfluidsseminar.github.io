<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> The speaker will discuss a range of problems involving active biological systems motivated by the ecophysiology of social insects that collectively behave as super-organisms. These include the morphogenesis and physiology of termite mounds, and active mechanisms for the self-organized ventilation, temperature control, and mechanical adaptation in bee hives.
