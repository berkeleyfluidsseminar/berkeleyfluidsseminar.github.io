Arterial Blood Clots">Understanding Blood Flow And Flow-mediated
Transport Around Arterial Blood Clots</br></a></p>




<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Pathological clotting of blood,
referred to as Thrombosis, comprises a major cause of several major
cardiovascular diseases including stroke and heart attack.
Additionally, thrombotic events induced by medical devices, or during
surgical procedures, significantly reduce treatment efficacy and
patient recovery.  Advancing our understanding of the fundamental
processes underlying thrombosis is therefore critical.  A major
challenge in this regard is to resolve the unsteady, pulsatile,
arterial blood flow around, and hemodynamic loading on, realistic
thrombi possessing arbitrary shape and microstructure.  In this talk,
I will discuss some of our recent work in addressing this challenge,
using multi-scale hybrid particle-continuum computational approaches.
The aspect of handling arbitrary morphology and microstructural
heterogeneity will be elucidated, and its role on flow and
flow-mediated transport in the thrombus neighborhood will be
discussed. In particular, I will illustrate our findings on how flow
organizes transport phenomena in the vicinity of large arterial clots.
Finally, the resolution of flow induced loading on realistic thrombi,
and subsequent thrombus mechanical response will be briefly
illustrated.
