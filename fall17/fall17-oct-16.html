<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> The baroclinic-mode
decomposition is a fixture of the tropical-dynamics literature due to
its simplicity and apparent usefulness in understanding a wide range
of atmospheric phenomena. However, its derivation relies on the
assumption that the tropopause is a rigid lid, which artificially
restricts the vertical propagation of wave energy. This causes
tropospheric buoyancy anomalies of a single vertical mode to remain
coherent for all time in the absence of dissipation. Here, we derive
the Green’s functions for these baroclinic modes in a two-dimensional
troposphere (or, equivalently, a three-dimensional troposphere with
one translational symmetry) that is overlain by a stratosphere. These
Green’s functions quantify the propagation and spreading of gravity
waves generated by a horizontally localized heating, and they can be
used to reconstruct the evolution of any tropospheric heating. For a
first-baroclinic two-dimensional right-moving or left-moving gravity
wave with a characteristic width of 100 km, its initial horizontal
shape becomes unrecognizable after 4 hours, at which point its initial
amplitude has also been reduced by a factor of 1/π. After this time,
the gravity wave assumes a universal shape that widens linearly in
time. For gravity waves on a periodic domain the length of Earth’s
circumference, it takes only 10 days for the gravity waves to spread
their buoyancy throughout the entire domain.
