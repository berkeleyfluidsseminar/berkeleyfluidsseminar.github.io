<p align="center"><b>Controlling Splashing and Slippage on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">In this talk, I will demonstrate how to modify surfaces to alter bulk flow using hydrophobic micro-structures.  The wax-like micro-textures display superhydrophobicity, yielding a large static contact angle of water droplet with a low contact angle hysteresis.  Two dynamical scenarios: drop impact and laminar flow on superhydrophobic surface, will be presented.  At a high impact velocity splashing of water droplet can occur, emitting secondary droplets. Moreover, the splashing dynamics is strongly influenced by the micro-patterns of the substrate. In microfluidic laminar flow, the geometry of the liquid-gas interface affects slippage, i.e. drag reduction, using hydrophobic micro-structures.  We found that air and air flow play an important role in these two scenarios, revealing the importance of developing an active control of the gas-liquid interface at the flow boundary.</p>
