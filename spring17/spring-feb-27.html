 I will provide an overview of fluid modeling and simulation capabilities used at the Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering at Berkeley Lab.  I will talk about how we use mathematics to derive models for all sorts of fluid simulations (from microscale flow to to exploding stars), and how we implement our algorithms on the world's largest supercomputers. </p>
