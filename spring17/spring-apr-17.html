<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> A micro-continuum approach is
proposed to simulate the dissolution of solid minerals at the
pore-scale under single-phase-flow conditions.  The approach employ a
the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes formulation and locally averaged
conservation laws combined with immersed boundary conditions for the
chemical reaction at the solid surface. The methodology compares well
with the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian technique. The simulation
framework is validated using an experimental microfluidic device to
image the dissolution of a single calcite crystal. The evolution of
the calcite crystal during the acidizing process is analyzed and
related to flow conditions, i.e., Péclet and Damköhler
numbers. Macroscopic laws for the dissolution rate are proposed by
upscaling the pore-scale simulations. Finally, the emergence of
wormholes during the injection of acid in a two-dimensional domain of
calcite grains is discussed based on pore-scale simulations. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Biography: </b>Dr. Cyprien Soulaine is a
Research Associate in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering
at Stanford University.  Cyprien has a PhD in Fluid Dynamics from the
Institut de Mécanique des Fluides de Toulouse, France (2012).  His
work uses fundamental research on fluid flow and transport in porous
media to bridge the gap between the scales and to develop relevant
mathematical models and simulation tools at different scales. His
research on porous media applies to very different domains such as
chemical engineering (adsorption and distillation processes for air
separation units and carbon capture), nuclear engineering (cooling of
superconductor magnets with superfluid Helium), and subsurface
engineering (water resources management, CO2 sequestration, acid
stimulation, Enhanced Oil Recovery, unconventional resources).

Dr. Soulaine is very involved with the community open source software
OpenFOAM. In May, Dr. Soulaine will teach
a <a href="https://www.interpore.org/events/workshops/short-course-introduction-to-fluid-mechanics-simulation-using-the-openfoam-technology-simulation-in-porous-media-from-pore-to-large-scale">course</a>
