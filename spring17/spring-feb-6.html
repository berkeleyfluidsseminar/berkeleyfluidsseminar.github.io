<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
The dynamics of a beach system are mediated by the flow of water due to surface waves that crash onto it. The flow is responsible for changes in the beach morphology through sediment transport and is, in turn, influenced by these changes in beach profile. The most important region of the beach for such changes is the region that is alternatively wet and dry with each incoming wave. We present insights into this flow from experimental and theoretical investigations. The focus is on understanding what parameters of the incoming waves control the flow on the beach and the physical mechanisms by which they do so. In particular, we see that the complexity of the flow due to waves can be reduced to a few parameters, which can be related to properties of the incident wave. The results have implications for predicting coastal flooding risks as well as improving numerical models. </p>
