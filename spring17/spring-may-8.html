<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b>  Bubbles supported on capillaries submerged in liquids are often used as part of experimental setups for conducting interfacial rheology measurements and coalescence experiments. One such system is the recently developed Dynamic Fluid-Film Interferometer (DFI) in which bubbles supported on capillaries are used to perform single bubble coalescence experiments. The first part of the talk focuses on a new phenomenon discovered during the initial design of the DFI – a bifurcation in the equilibrium states of bubbles expanding and contracting on capillaries. This bifurcation is a consequence of gas compressibility and results in a hysteretic phenomenon, which we have termed as the bubble shape hysteresis. Understanding bubble shape hysteresis is crucial to applications requiring precise control over the size of bubbles formed on capillaries. The second part of the talk focuses on DFI experiments aimed at developing foam resistant lubricants. Foam stability tests on oils from the four common base oil groups (as defined by the American Petroleum Institute) indicate that Group I and IV oils are the most and least prone to foaming, respectively. Reconstructed film profiles during thin film drainage leading up coalescence show that solutocapillary Marangoni flows are responsible for the foam stabilization in lubricant base oils. </p>
