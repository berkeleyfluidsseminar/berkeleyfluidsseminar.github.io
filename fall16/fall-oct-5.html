<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Thrombosis and embolism are crucial vascular events that comprise the leading cause of multiple diseases including heart attack and stroke. The severity of the consequences, and complexity of the mechanics, of these phenomena have led to considerable research interest. In this presentation, we will explore computational modeling frameworks devised through a combination of image-based modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and discrete particle based methods - to develop tools for investigating embolus transport and thrombotic occlusions within large artery hemodynamics. A prominent focus will be on the interaction of inertial particles with arterial hemodynamics, and its effect on embolus transport. In addition, techniques capable of resolving unsteady, pulsatile flow interaction with arbitrary clot morphologies typical of realistic clots will be explored. We will characterize the statistics of embolus transport to the brain and other vital organs, using patient geometries spanning from the aorta to the brain, and to the lower abdomen. Identifying the source of emboli is essential for diagnosis and long-term treatment, but co-existing potential embolus sources make this a difficult task. Our research has enabled us to address this source-destination relationship, providing ways to identify differences between cardiogenic and aortogenic embolus transport to the brain. Origin of emboli from clots is intimately related to hemodynamic loading, and we will demonstrate the efficacy of our computational techniques in characterizing flow structures and hemodynamic loading around an arbitrarily grown clot at arterial length-scales. Furthermore, an analysis of micro-scale clot-hemodynamics interaction will be explored, with emphasis on transport through the platelet plug forming the clot and the effect of clot micro-morphology on flow and transport. Key implications of the obtained results with regards to treatment planning and device design for patients will be discussed.
