<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> I will present a novel high-order sliding and deforming spectral difference (SD^2) method for solving compressible Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured quadrilateral grids. The SD^2 method is an extension of the sliding-mesh spectral difference method (Zhang & Liang, 2015, J. Computational Physics) to coupled rotating and deforming domains. Through a simple sliding-mesh interface, the SD^2 method mitigates large grid distortion which is often resulted from rotating wall boundaries. Meanwhile, the SD^2 algorithm adopts an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework that can handle large-amplitude translational motions of grid points on deforming domains. This new SD^2 solver is verified by using several benchmark flow problems able to demonstrate optimal orders of accuracy in space. Simulations results for a vertical axis wind turbine and a system of two oscillating wings in tandem will be presented. The SD^2 method is efficient and robust for all our test problems and is expected to be a competitive algorithm for simulating turbulent flows of wind turbines by using exascale computers in the near future.
