<p align="center"><b> Two dimensional water waves in holomorphic coordinates </b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b>  My talk is concerned with the irrotational infinite/finite depth water wave equations in two space dimensions, with either gravity or surface tension. I will also make some remarks on constant vorticity (infinite depth) case when only gravity is considered.

We consider this problem expressed in position-velocity potential holomorphic coordinates. We will explain the set up of the problem(s) and try to present the advantages of choosing such a framework.  Viewing this problem(s) as a quasilinear dispersive equation, we develop new methods which will be used to prove enhanced lifespan of solutions and also global solutions for small and localized data. The talk will try to be self contained. </p>
