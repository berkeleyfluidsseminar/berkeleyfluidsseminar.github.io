<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Thrombosis, or pathological blood clotting, is highly associated with regions of altered hemodynamics such as stenoses, aneurysms, bifurcations, and implants. The nature of this relationship, however, is complex and still somewhat poorly understood. Numerical models provide a valuable investigative tool. In this talk, I will present two of our previous works. In the first, biomechanical fluid-stress-induced platelet activation potential is computed in patient-specific models of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease.  This activation potential is modeled using both Lagrangian particle-tracking and Eulerian continuum approaches. Contrary to the hypotheses of previous researchers, we found that biomechanical platelet activation is unlikely to be significant in these flows, implying that transport likely plays a key role. In the second work, we develop a reduced-dimensional surface transport model for high-Schmidt-number near-wall mass transport problems as are commonly found in cardiovascular applications. Using a technique similar to the von Karman momentum integral method, the advection-diffusion equation is reduced to a codimension-one transport equation that is solved on the surface manifold of the blood vessel, significantly reducing computational cost. Asymptotic solutions are developed for the reaction-rate-limited and transport-limited regimes, and results show good comparison to those from the full advection-diffusion equation. </p>
