<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Despite continuous improvement in medical technologies and imaging, cardiovascular disease forms the leading cause of mortality and death, necessitating development of alternative technologies. Computational modeling provides a low cost, non-invasive modality to complement animal testing and routine clinical care. Simulation-based diagnosis has demonstrated a growing impact in the clinic, ultimately leading to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. While this translation has been successfully achieved in vascular flow applications, cardiac hemodynamics (representing blood flow in heart chambers) has remained distant to clinical translation, partly due to the significant cost and complexity involved in modeling the underlying dynamics. These include high Reynolds number flows, moving chambers and fluid-structure interaction effects, in addition to the complex multiphysics interactions. In this talk, I will review some of the previous efforts, together with my own research on computational modeling of intracardiac flows. In particular, I will focus on the methods required to handle the above complexities, and how these methods were used to develop fundamental insights into the blood transport mechanisms in the heart, from using both simplified canonical heart models to complex image-based patient-specific models. I will then present the most recent advances made on modeling cardiac hemodynamics that are promising for clinical translation, and conclude by providing future directions in this area of research. </p>
