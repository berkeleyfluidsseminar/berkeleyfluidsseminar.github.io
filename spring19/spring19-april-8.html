<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b>  Dr. Hassanzadeh studies fluid dynamics and heat transfer in complex natural phenomena and engineering systems using numerical, mathematical, and statistical models, guided by observational and experimental data. The main theme of his work is understanding multi-scale processes at fundamental levels and then applying this knowledge to real-world and practical problems. Examples of problems of interest are environmental and geophysical flows, reduced-order modeling of turbulent flows, extreme weather events, flow control in energy systems, climate/weather modeling, and numerical and mathematical modeling of thermo-fluid processes. His work often involves developing and employing high-resolution numerical models, devising stochastic prototypes, and analyzing big datasets.  </b> </p>
