<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> When placed on the surface of a volatile liquid, a sufficiently small hot sphere of denser
matter skates over the surface until it cools and sinks. Surface tension sets a upper limit to
the particle size which can be thus supported. In experiments, the largest particles appear
to approach this limit [Hall et al. <i>Nature</i> 1969]. Based on their experiments, Adda–Bedia et
al. [<i>Langmuir</i> 2016] argue that the vapour, in effect, causes a sphere to become non–wetting
with respect to the liquid. In that case, neither the phenomenon of skating, nor knowledge of
the precise value of the superheat, would be essential to understanding particle levitation. To
test that conclusion, levitation of a stationary sphere is analysed here. The Reynolds equation
governing the pressure distribution within the vapour film is coupled to the Laplace–Young
equation determining the response of the pool surface to that pressure. This B.V.P. has an
elementary solution describing the limit in which the sphere load vanishes compared with
the surface tension force available to support it. The pool surface is then asymptotically flat,
allowing film pressure and interface profile to be found as explicit functions of dimensionless
load <span style="font-family: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive">L</span>, superheat &epsilon;, and Bond number <span style="font-family: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive">B</span>. For finite <span style="font-family: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive">L</span>, fixed &epsilon; and vanishing <span style="font-family: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive">B</span>, numerical
solutions show that, for a given film thickness <math>h<sub>0</sub></math> at the sphere bottom, two interface shapes
are possible: one corresponds to a low value of the pressure <math>p<sub>0</sub></math> at the sphere bottom; the
other, to a higher value of <math>p<sub>0</sub></math> , and to the presence at the sphere bottom of a thin bubble cap
having imperfectly sealed rim, through which vapour escapes to the atmosphere. Above a
certain <math>p<sub>0</sub></math>, there appears to be no solution to the B.V.P. When the superheat &epsilon; is reduced,
this maximum <math>p<sub>0</sub></math> approaches a limit, but the supportable load vanishes because the vapour
bubble shrinks in angular extent. For realistic values of &epsilon;, the maximum size of a stationary
particle which can be supported is small compared those found experimentally. This suggests
skating is essential to the phenomenon; this might be tested by studying experimentally the
behaviour of a hot bead freely sliding on a vertical wire.
