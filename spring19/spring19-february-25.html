Recent progress and challenges in modeling Rayleigh−Taylor instability-induced turbulent
mixing using Reynolds-averaged turbulence models are reviewed. This includes efforts to use an
advanced, multicomponent <i>K−&epsilon;</i> model that incorporates terms generally neglected in other
models, as well as comparisons of predictions of this model with those from the <i>K−L−a</i> model.
Applications of these models to a variety of Rayleigh−Taylor unstable, as well as stable, cases
with different Atwood numbers are presented and discussed. It is shown that the predictions of
the <i>K−&epsilon;</i> model are consistent with results from implicit large-eddy simulations (ILES) of
miscible mixing, and that the predictions of the <i>K−L−a</i> model are consistent with immiscible
mixing. For Rayleigh−Taylor flows with stable phases, it is shown that the <i>K−&epsilon;</i> model predicts
trends in agreement with simulation and experimental data. Some of the important challenges
facing the Reynolds-averaged modeling approach are also briefly discussed, including model
calibration to data, and ambiguities in the choice of initial conditions. </p>
