<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Natural particles suspended in water are often non-spherical.  We explore the ways in which particle size and shape affect particle motion in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow.  Laboratory measurements and numerical simulations are used to explore the kinematics of particles.  Particle shapes are idealized and motivated by open questions in environmental engineering, notably regarding plankton, sediment aggregates, and autonomous vehicles.  The results provide the basis for stochastic modeling of particles in aquatic environments, as well as some new perspectives from which to view turbulence.  One highlight from the results is that shape has only a very weak effect on particle angular velocity calculated with respect the global reference frame (i.e. east/north/up) and a significant effect in a particle's local frame.  The explanation for this effect is different for small and large particles.
