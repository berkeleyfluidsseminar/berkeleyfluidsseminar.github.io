<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b>  Professor Howard A. Stone received the Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California at Davis in 1982 and the PhD in Chemical Engineering from Caltech in 1988. Following a postdoctoral year in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, in 1989 he joined the faculty of the (now) School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, where he eventually became the Vicky Joseph Professor of Engineering and Applied Mathematics. In 1994 Professor Stone received both the Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Award and the Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize, which are the only two teaching awards given to faculty in Harvard College. In 2000 he was named a Harvard College Professor for his contributions to undergraduate education. In July 2009 he moved to Princeton University where he is Donald R. Dixon 69 and Elizabeth W. Dixon Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Within the last decade, several industrialized countries have stressed the importance of advanced manufacturing, such as 3D Printing (3DP), to their economies. The combination of rigorous material modeling theories and robotic control, coupled with dramatic increases of computational power, can potentially play a significant role in the analysis and design of many emerging, multistage, additive manufacturing systems. The goal of these systems is to build structures that are otherwise extremely difficult or impossible to construct using classical manufacturing methods. Ultimately, the objective of 3DP is to develop superior products, manufactured at lower overall operational costs. In many emerging 3DP systems, such processes involve attaching multi-material dispensers to robots, which then release functionalized, complex, multiphase, material mixtures in free-space. These approaches are becoming popular because they utilize preexisting widely-available, highly-programmable, robots, which have been developed for decades.  However, often the release of a complex mixture in free-space is imprecise, thus electromagnetic field control has been proposed as one possible remedy to enhance the precision of such processes, by rapidly guiding the material to a desired target position. Thereafter, lasers are used to irradiate the deposited material to a desired state. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Bio: </b>  Tarek I. Zohdi received his Ph.D. in 1997 in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin and his Habilitation in General Mechanics from the Gottfried Leibniz University of Hannover in 2002. He is currently a Chancellor&apos;s Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Chair of the Computational and Data Science and Engineering Program at UC Berkeley and holder of the W. C. Hall Family Endowed Chair in Engineering.  He also holds a Staff Scientist position at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. His main research interests are in computational approaches for advanced manufacturing and nonconvex multiscale-multiphysics inverse problems, in particular addressing the issue of how large numbers of micro-constituents interact to produce macroscale aggregate behavior.  He has published over 160 archival refereed journal papers and eight books. He is a Fellow of International Association for Computational Mechanics (IACM, 2008) and United States Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM, 2009) and served as President of the USACM from 2012 to 2014.  He is an editor of Computational Mechanics, Editor in Chief of Computational Particle Mechanics and serves on 11 editorial boards of international journals. </p>
