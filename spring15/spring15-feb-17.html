<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Dedalus is a new computational framework for solving general partial differential equations relevant to many contemporary applications in astrophysics, geosciences, mathematical biology, and beyond. This toolkit is designed for maximum extensibility by a large community of scientists and applied mathematicians. In this talk, I will describe the code and demonstrate it's ease-of-use by writing and running an example problem in real time. I will also discuss one of several scientific problems we have already tackled with Dedalus: the excitation of internal gravity waves by convection.
