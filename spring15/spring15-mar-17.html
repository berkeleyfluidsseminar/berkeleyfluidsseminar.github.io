<p align="center"><b>How Symmetric is Symmetric Instability?</b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> The pure symmetric instability is an instability of oceanic and atmospheric fronts that is independent of the along-front coordinate. Observational evidence suggests that along-front variability in vertical velocity and sea surface temperature anomaly is not negligible. We examine the three-dimensional evolution of frontal shear instabilities from both linear and non-linear perspectives. Linear stability analysis indicates that dominant growth rates are possible when modes are off-symmetric. Additionally, along-front variability results in misalignment of perturbations with respect to isopycnals, yielding strong fluxes across isopycnals. A suite of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are performed exploring a horizontally homogeneous front with differing horizontal domain sizes. For sufficiently large domains, the front maintains along-front variation and a pure symmetric instability is not observed. Lastly, transition to turbulence is explored using large-scale simulations. Vorticity dynamics and bulk energetics illustrate important features of the transition.</p>
