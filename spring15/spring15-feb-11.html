<p align="center"><b>Coriolis force effects on turbulent shear flows  </b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Flow in rotating systems are encountered in astrophysical, geophysical and industrial fluid mechanics. The presence of the Coriolis force are known to affect the mean fluid motion in geophysical applications. The shorter length and time scales in engineering devices make the Coriolis force also affect the turbulence. The talk will address Coriolis-force effects on both the mean flow and the turbulence. A variety of different shear flows of engineering relevance will be presented to illustrate the most striking flow phenomena caused by the Coriolis force.  We will see that both the turbulence level and the turbulence anisotropy are changed due to system rotation and the extent of zones of separated flow varies with the rate of system rotation.
