<p align="center"><b> Is the sun rapidly rotating? </b></p><br>
<p align="justify">  I will discuss this question in the context of solar convection and heat transport.  The talk will discuss geostrophic balance and the Taylor-Proudman Theorem in terms of solar parameters in the convection zone.  I will show how simple arguments about dominant balances and scaling can lead to conclusions about flow structure and dynamics. The degree of rotational constraint in the solar convection zone strongly affect the sun's maintenance of differential rotation and magnetic field; two of the longest-standing challenges theoretical physics. <br>
