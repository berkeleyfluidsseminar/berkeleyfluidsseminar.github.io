<p align="center"><b> High-order Discontinuous Galerkin methods for compressible flows on moving-domains with large deformation</b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> We present two different numerical approaches for solving compressible flows on moving domains with high-order accuracy. The approaches are base on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and are particularly designed for addressing the large deformation problems as the domain moves. A moving-mesh technique is first introduced to improve the mesh quality with the domain deforming. Based on these mesh techniques, we formulate space-time framework and arbitrary-Lagragian-Eulerian (ALE) framework using a nodal DG discretization. Finally, we illustrate our two approaches by a number of numerical tests in both 2D and 3D. <br>
