<p align="center"><b> Shear instabilities at low P&eacute;clet number</b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> This work addresses stratified shear flows at low P&eacute;clet number but
high Reynolds number. This little-studied limit is relevant in some
astrophysical systems, where the Prandtl number is often very small.
Furthermore, it can be studied using a reduced set of
''low-P&eacute;clet-number equations''. I will discuss the linear stability
and energy-stability properties of spatially periodic flows in this
limit, and discuss the results of Direct Numerical Simulations.
