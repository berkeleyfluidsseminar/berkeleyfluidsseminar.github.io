<p align="center"><b>Stationary spatially localized states in rotating convection</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">We study two-dimensional convection in a horizontal fluid layer rotating around the vertical and heated from below. With stress-free boundary conditions, stationary spatially localized convection is present. These states are embedded in a background shear layer and lie on a pair of intertwined solution branches exhibiting "slanted snaking", meaning that less localized solutions are obtained by gradually increasing the forcing. Similar solutions, but with no-slip boundary conditions, are no longer embedded in a background shear and exhibit "standard snaking", i.e. snaking without a slant where all the localized solutions exist under the same conditions. An explanation of the numerical methods will be given.</p>
