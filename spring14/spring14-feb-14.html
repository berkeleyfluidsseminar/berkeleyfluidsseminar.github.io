<p align="center"><b>Wall-layer models for large-eddy simulations</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">With the advent of powerful computers eddy resolving techniques, such as the large-eddy simulation (LES) approach, are constantly expanding into new application areas in a variety of fields. In the case of high Reynolds number, wall-bounded turbulent flows, however, the resolution requirements render LES impractical due to cost considerations. The size of the energetic near-wall turbulent structures decreases as the Reynolds number increases and the overall cost due to the need to refine the computational grid is proportional to ~Re^2.6. Today, most of the effort to overcome this limitation is centered around the development of wall-layer models (WLM), where the area near the solid boundary is bypassed and modeled. In this seminar we will review the most significant developments in WLM strategies over the past decades. Emphasis will be placed on recent hybrid implementations, as well as, on the development of WLM for immersed-boundary type methods, which have gained enormous popularity over the past decade.</p>
