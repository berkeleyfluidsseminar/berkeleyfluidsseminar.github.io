<p align="center"><b>Transformation Optics and its application</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">Transformation Optics offers an unprecedented method of manipulating a variety of waves through architecting the propagation medium. The necessary condition for a wave to be controllable by this method is that its governing equation must be form-invariant under coordinate transformation. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves is an examples of such systems. In transformation optics, the coordinate transformation is translated into material properties, which are usually anisotropic and spatially varying. These constitutive parameters of materials could be approximated using artificial (meta)materials. Idea of Transformation Optics with analogy could be applied in other areas of science such as water surface waves, acoustic waves, elastodynamic waves or even seismic waves, in order to design new materials to steer and control these waves. New devices can be designed using this method to concentrate, scatter or rotate waves or even cloak a region of space from these waves. In this talk, I will review concepts associated with Transformation Media and illustrate its application by examples. I will also discuss numerical simulation of 'bending wave-guides' for water surface waves, which we designed using methods in transformation optics.</p>
