<p align="center"><b>Modeling and Optimization for Intermittent Water Supply</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">In cities throughout the developing world, piped water is supplied only intermittently, as valves are used to direct water to different parts of a water distribution system at different times. The causes of intermittency are complex, but several consequences are clear: degradation of water quality and of distribution system components. This talk will introduce the problem, go over a simple model for transient dynamics, and present preliminary results for optimization problems motivated by practical concerns. Specifically, I will look at controlling valve parameters which occur as boundary conditions in a network model of transition flow through pipes.</p>
