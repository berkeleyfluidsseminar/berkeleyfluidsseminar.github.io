<p align="justify"> 
<b> Abstract: </b> Urban water distribution networks do not always supply water continuously or reliably. Hundreds of millions of people in cities worldwide regularly experience intermittent water supply, a condition that degrades distribution system components, compromises water quality, and limits water availability. I will introduce the phenomenon of intermittent water supply and our implementation of an efficient computational model of transient, transition flow through a network of closed pipes. This model is coupled with optimization for several applications. I discuss how simple fluid mechanics principles can help identify difficult modeling regimes in real water distribution networks with intermittent supply, and, if time, will describe the role of uncertain parameters.
