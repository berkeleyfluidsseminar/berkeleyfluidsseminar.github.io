<p align="center"><b> Measuring mixing efficiency in stratified flows  </b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> 
Quantifying the efficiency of mixing in stratified flows has been studied for the last twenty years and mixing efficiency is an important quantity in many ocean and climate models. In the past it has been common practice to assume a value for the mixing efficiency of 20%. However, recent laboratory experiments of Rayleigh-Taylor instability between two otherwise stably-stratified layers have shown that mixing efficiencies as high as 75% are possible. This experimental research and accompanying computational simulations have revealed important aspects about the way that energy removed by mixing is measured, leading to new questions about how best to measure and describe turbulent mixing in stratified flows.
