<p align="justify"> 
Fluctuations in the geomagnetic field originate due to motions in the conductive fluid in Earth’s outer core and give us valuable insights into Earth’s inner workings. Many authors have proposed a buoyantly stratified layer just under the core-mantle boundary sometimes called the “Stratified Ocean of the Core” in analogy with Earth’s liquid water oceans. If this layer exists, it could support large-scale long period waves detectable in through geomagnetic variation. The highly coupled nature of the governing equations for conductive fluids make analytical solutions difficult and highly approximate, but the problem is amenable to numerical solutions. In this talk, a numerical hybrid finite-volume and spectral eigenvalue approach for studying magnetohydrodynamic waves in a thin spherical layer is presented and preliminary results are discussed.
