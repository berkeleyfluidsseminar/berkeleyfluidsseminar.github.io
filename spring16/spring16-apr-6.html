<p align="justify"> 
<b> Abstract: </b> Models of dense river flows into lakes typically model exchange between the river and lake waters as entrainment along the length of a gravity current and a single intrusion into the lake at the depth of neutral buoyancy. I will show laboratory experiments of basins fed by dense gravity currents that visualize clearly a different kind of exchange - a detrainment of fluid from the gravity current into the stratified ambient water simultaneously across a range of depths. Our work shows that the observed filling basin stratifications are better described by a simple model that includes this detrainment process than by a commonly used entrainment model for a gravity current filling a basin.
