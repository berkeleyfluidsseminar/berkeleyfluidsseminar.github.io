<p align="center"><b> Blood Flow Reduced Model Simulations: Data-based Modelling, Surgical Planning and Device Design for Congenital Heart Disease  </b></p><br>
<p align="justify"> 
In recent years, we explored several ways to reduce the computational complexity of blood flow simulations, while keeping the solution meaningful in the domain of interest. We will present examples of dimensional model reduction and POD (proper orthogonal decomposition). We have also devised strategies of model parametrisation based on the available data. These methods will be demonstrated in the context of congenital heart diseases such as state evaluation in aortic coarctation, surgical planning of single ventricle physiology, or device design for Tetralogy of Fallot palliation.
