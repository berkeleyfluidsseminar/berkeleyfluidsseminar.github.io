<p align="center"><b>Direct Numerical Simulation of Electrokinetic Instability and Hydrodynamic Chaos Near Ion-Selective Surfaces</b></p><br>
<p align="justify">Electrokinetic phenomena (e.g. in electrochemical or microfluidic systems) are often described by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. However, the mainstream models describing solutions to these equations are based on asymptotic simplifications including bulk electroneutrality, quasi-steadiness, and/or quasi-equilibrium. In this presentation we will demonstrate the need for the development of specialized algorithms for simulation	of electrokinetic phenomena, similar to the tools that have been traditionally used for	simulation of turbulent	flows. At the core of our investigation we consider ion	transport through an ion-selective surface as a	model problem with applications in electrochemistry, such as water purification, electrolysis and lab-on-a-chip	system.	We will present	results	from our research and show that direct calculations, without asymptotic simplifications, can predict electrokinetic chaos with multi-scale vortices consistent with recent experimental observations. These calculations require resolving a wide range of spatio-temporal scales using unsteady solvers and often need massively parallel computational resources. Similar to turbulence simulations and in contrast to the mainstrean commercial software, non-dissipative numerical discretization is crucial for effective preservation of physics of chaotic vortices. We will discuss how development of such high-fidelity tools	can lead to fundamental understanding of complex effects in electrokinetic systems and facilitate their design and optimization.</p>
