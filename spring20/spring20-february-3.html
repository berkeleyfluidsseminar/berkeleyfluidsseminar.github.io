<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Accidental fire is the most costly peril for commercial and industrial facilities, with the total fire loss equal to the combined losses due to all natural hazards. The technical complexity related to the highly-coupled physical and chemical processes in fire and suppression has restricted the industrial fire protection solution to be mostly dependent on full-scale testing and empirical analysis. The early CFD fire modeling work has been limited to only a small part of the practical fire problem, such as smoke transport of a pre-determined fire size. This talk will present the recent progress that enables fully-coupled fire growth and suppression simulations. The sub-models include turbulent diffusion combustion, convective and radiative heat transfer, solid fuel pyrolysis, droplet atomization and transport, surface film flow and fuel suppression, etc. It will be demonstrated that a validated CFD model has been applied to industrial fire hazard evaluation and suppression designs, either along with experiments or solely by itself as a predictive tool. On-going research tasks and future challenges, especially those related to thermal fluids, will be highlighted.  </p>
